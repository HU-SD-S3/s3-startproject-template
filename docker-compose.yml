# Running "docker-compose up" (active process)

# One can connect to it using your DB client
# (IntelliJ, DataGrip, pqadmin, psql, ...),
# using the following parameters (see: application.properties):
#   url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:15432/bep2-huland-casino

#   password = bep2-huland-casino
version: "3.7"
services:

    image: postgres

      # This means you can connect to 'localhost:15432' from your computer
      # and it will patch it through to the container-port 5432

    volumes:
      # Required volume: creates the initial db and user
