# S3 Project
This project is part of an assignment for 3rd semester of the ICT bachelor programme at the
Hogeschool Utrecht, University of Applied Sciences.

## Starter project
This starter project contains the following:

* A Maven-based setup with several 
third-party libraries and frameworks (see: `pom.xml`)
* A preconfigured Spring project
* A component for JWT-based 
user authentication and authorisation (`nl.hu.s3.project.security`)
* A container-based development environment for PostgreSQL 
(see: `development/db/Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`)

## Prerequisites
Although it is recommended to always use the latest stable version
of Java, this project requires a version of Java 21 or higher.
You can customize this in your compilation settings and `pom.xml`.

For [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html),
you can use your IDE, install it [globally](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), 
or use the supplied `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`.

## Project setup with Docker
Although not supported on every system,
Development is easiest with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
If Docker is installed,
you can start the database by executing
`docker-compose up` from the commandline
(or `docker-compose start` to run it in the background),
while the current directory is the root of this project.
Docker will then start a PostgreSQL container, based on the official PostgreSQL image, with
the configuration stated in the `docker-compose.yml` and in `development/db`.

### Troubleshooting Docker
If you already have PostgreSQL running in the background
and you don't want to stop that process,
you will have to change the port-binding from `15432:5432`
to something else, for instance `25432:5432` in `docker-compose.yml`
and in `src/resources/application.properties`. Don't forget to
change this in your development environment's database client as well.

If data does not seem to be persisted when restarting the
database, make sure Docker has a volume assigned to it.
Add the project's directory or parent directory
under Docker's `Settings > Resources > File Sharing`.

If you cannot seem to connect to the database,
make sure Docker is allowed to use the host's network.

If all else fails, setup your database manually according
to the steps explained above. Remember: it is OK to ask for help!

## Booting
First, make sure the database is set up, started and reachable.

Start the application via your IDE by running the `CasinoApplication`
class. Alternatively, run `mvn spring-boot:start`.

## How do authentication and authorisation work?
The security component allows users to register and login.
Its general configuration is found in `nl.hu.s3.project.SecurityConfig`.
Authentication is configured in `...presentation.filter.JwtAuthenticationFilter`,
while Authorization is handled `...presentation.filter.JwtAuthorizationFilter`.

> :warning: The following is already handled by the imported Postman
> collection!

### Registration
Users can be registered via the API. 
Passwords are [hashed](https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-passwords-one-way-road-to-security/) 
using a password encoder ([bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)),
so that passwords are not stored in plain-text.

Registration can be done via a POST request to `/register`.
A body should be supplied with the following JSON 
(replace values to your liking):
```json
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin",
    "firstName": "Ad",
    "lastName": "Min"
}
```

### Login
The login is based on 
[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/), 
offering session-less authorisation.

Login by sending a POST request to `/login`, with
the following body (replace values to your liking):
```json
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
}
``` 

A `200 OK` is returned upon a successful login. The
JWT token is found as a Bearer token in the 
Authorization header of the response.

Copy this exact header in subsequent requests in order to remain logged in!
Note that the supplied Postman collection does this automatically!
